# "Java Learning Zone" app (SGBD-project)

There is the backend repository for the "Java Learning Zone" app, developed as part of my SGBD (System and Database Management) class. This repository focuses on the backend component, which leverages PL/SQL queries to interact with the database. The "Java Learning Zone" app is designed to provide an interactive platform for testing and enhancing Java programming skills. In this backend repository, we've incorporated PL/SQL queries to ensure seamless communication between the Java application and the database.
